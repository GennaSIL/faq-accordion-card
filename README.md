## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

### Almost done

This is an almost finished project. there are few more things to add, like some style changes when accordion expandes. maybe some tweaks to some of the paadings and margins in the design.
An issue I'm facing is changing the accordion arrow color, can't find how to do it. will continue to investigate.
