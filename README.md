## Overview

### work in progress

This is an unfinished project. I'm uploading as it is to git hub in order to learn more about git features so the project will continue to be uploaded as I work on it. Maybe ill get input on my code and have more opportunities to upgrade it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap [https://getbootstrap.com/]

### What I learned

At this point in the project I learned how to implament a Bootstrap accordion element and tinker with it.

### Continued development

I need to finish the desktop design and add js to handle changes in styles when you press stuff.
Also, his project has a very different design for mobile display, I think next I'll create a comletely new css for small displays and use js to switch between them.
